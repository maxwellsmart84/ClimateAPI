# ClimateAPI

Climacell API in Python for Charleston, SC - this will give air quality reports from Climacell when the function is ran.


This is a sample python project I did to familarize myself with Python before I taught for TEALS
If you have ever considered teaching I found this to be a great program!  Help the youth! Help our industry! **HACK THE PLANET!**
